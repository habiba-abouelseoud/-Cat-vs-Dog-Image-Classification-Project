# Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classification-Project

## Overview:
This project focuses on training machine learning classifiers to determine whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The dataset consists of images originally sourced from the Kaggle competition Dogs vs. Cats. Both training and test datasets are provided, with class labels embedded in the filenames ("cat" or "dog").

## Objectives:
Train machine learning classifiers for binary cat vs. dog image classification.
Evaluate and compare the performance of various classification algorithms.
Report the best mean accuracy value over the test images.

## Implementation:
For detailed implementation, code snippets, and results, please refer to the corresponding sections within the project files.
